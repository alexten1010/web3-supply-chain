**Supply Chain Management DApp**

Blockchain Supply chain management plays a critical role in ensuring efficient operations and maintaining consumer trust. This project focuses on developing and deploying a decentralized application (DApp) powered by blockchain technology to streamline supply chain management processes.

**Utilizes:**
  NodeJs: v18.12.1
  NPM: 8.19.2

  Also set up with a web3 provider: Alchemy 
  Network: Polygon Mumbai


  **Tested with Hardhat.**

It has a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a supply chain contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract while using Remix to check code functionality.

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
